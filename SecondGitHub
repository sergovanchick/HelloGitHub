My second test GitHub
No or yes?



Recently, I whistled poetry once
And he gave them out without my signature;
The magazine buffoon wrote an article about them,
Without a signature, let it go, the villain.
But what about it? Neither to me, nor to the area jester
I couldn't cover up my pranks:
He recognized me by my claws in a minute,
I recognized him by his ears.
