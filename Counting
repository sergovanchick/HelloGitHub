One, two, three, four,
Let's count the holes in the cheese.
If there are a lot of holes in the cheese,
So the cheese will be delicious.
If there is one hole in it,
So it was delicious yesterday!

High‑apple
I threw my ball easily.
But my ball fell from the sky,
He rolled into the dark forest.
One, two, three, four, five,
I'm going to look for him.

Lunokhod, lunokhod
The moon is moving forward.
It takes him a long time to walk there.
And now you're driving!

The car was driving through a dark forest
For some interest.
Inte‑inte‑interest,
Come out with the letter "s"!
The letter "s" did not fit —
Come out with the letter "a".
The letter "a" is not good —
Come out with the letter "sha"!

The sun is in the sky!
Salt is on bread,
Cherry — in the garden,
And you are in plain sight!
No matter how you hide —
I will find,
I'm on my way!
